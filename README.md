## ðŸ§¾ Dataset Overview

- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Link:** [Online Retail II Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II)  
- **Timeframe:** December 2010 â€“ December 2011  
- **Size:** ~541,909 rows

This real-world dataset contains **customer transactions** for a UK-based online retailer. The data was **messy**, containing:
- Nulls in key fields (CustomerID, Description)

## ðŸ§¹ Key Steps Performed

### ðŸ§¼ 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed missing `CustomerID`s and irrelevant columns
- Filtered out canceled orders (Invoice starting with â€˜Câ€™)
- Converted timestamps into Month-Year format
- Cleaned negative or zero quantities and prices

### ðŸ§® 2. RFM Analysis
- Calculated **Recency, Frequency, Monetary** values per customer
- Scored each RFM metric from 1 to 5
- Built a **Customer Segment** field using RFM Score logic
    - Example: `'Champions'`, `'Loyal Customers'`, `'At Risk'`, etc.

### ðŸ“ˆ 3. Pivot & Aggregation
- Created summary pivot tables to analyze:
  - Monthly revenue by segment
  - Total revenue vs customer groups
  - Segment-wise distribution
  - Revenue contribution by segment

### ðŸ“Š 4. Interactive Excel Dashboard
- Designed with slicers for:
  - **RFM Score**
  - **Month-Year**
- Used formatted charts:
  - Clustered columns
  - Pie charts
  - Card KPIs (Revenue, Orders, Active Customers)
- Enhanced visuals with:
  - Conditional formatting
  - Number formatting in `K` / `M`
  - Custom background and textboxes
